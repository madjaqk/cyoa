# The Legend of Ethanicus, Courier of the Stars

## Introduction

I've been running a Choose Your Own Adventure-style game on Discord.

"Official" story pieces are in text blocks.  Things in italics are either audience responses or answers to questions that don't quite fit into the narrative (usually me clarifying something).

Things I wrote are usually in text blocks; responses from the audience are in italics.

Many thanks to everyone who's participated: Bean, ncrecc, Akumu, I Don't Know, 鏡　雨, Panda, and anyone else I've overlooked.

## Lore

### Characters

#### Ethanicus (the player character)

Male, human, behavior driven by whoever happens to be in chat at that moment.  Works as a courier/taxi/space trucker ("Han Solo without the smuggling" is my usual description).

#### Vinnie

Ethanicus's best friend and co-pilot.  He's a Ruamokan (a type of rock alien).  Seems easy-going?

#### Big Susan Valdman

A human organized crime figure in the sector that contains Crin'tik, Kanaloa, and a lot of the action so far.  Superficially sweet.  Getting out of her debt was a big motivator in Chapter 1: The Crin'tiki Gambit, or: Fliit's Big Night.

#### Fliit

A member of the Synod of 36, the governing body of Crin'tik's The Church of the Crying God.  He frequents underground coffee speakeasies, in defiance of the Church's teachings, as seen in Chapter 1: The Crin'tiki Gambit, or: Fliit's Big Night.

#### Teenu

Vinnie's ex-wife.  She's a Zervian (a type of ice alien).  A tenured professor of philosophy at North Zerv University.  Featured in Chapter 3: The Case of the Misappropriated Funds.

#### Jimbo

Ethanicus's estranged father, an arms dealer.  Introduced in Chapter 4: The Cat's In The Cradle.

### Aliens

#### Crin'tiki

I don't think I ever said this explicitly, but they're insectoid.  Coffee makes their mandibles glow and seems to have a vague psychoactive effect (at least, it seems to get them buzzed rather than hyper).

#### Ruamokans

Rock monsters.  Have more sensitive hearing than humans and less affected by ambient cold.

#### Pre-Zervians

Cat people.  Apparently they wiped themselves out in a war thousands of years ago.  Had advanced robot technology.

#### Zervians

Ice elementals.

### Factions

#### The Church of the Crying God

A Crin'tiki church, dedicated to spreading the True Message of the Crying God.  It was founded by Vav'v after the True Message was imparted to him directly.  Governed by the Synod of 36.  Currently dealing with a doctrinal dispute between Postmessagarians (who believe the Message was created at the moment of Impartation) and Antemessagarians (who believe the Message has always been embedded in the universe); Postmessagarians control the Synod, but there are some radical Antemessagarians advocating for a schism or worse.

#### Federated Space

Some sort of interplanetary governing body.  Has a President, a Parliament, a Patrol (combination of military and law enforcement), and an Education Council.  They're probably more like the United Nations than the United States, in terms of autonomy of its constituent planets?

#### Walanese groups

The Walanese government, the Walanese emperor-in-exile, the Walanese Liberation Army, and The People's Republic of Wala are fighting a vicious four-war war.  "You're pretty sure one is a reasonable group of activists fighting off encroaching authoritarianism (but occasionally too violently), two are jack-booted thugs (which still raise legitimate issues about the ideology of their opposition), and the last is either a theocratic death cult or burn-it-all-down radical anarchists, but you can never remember which group is which."


## Transcript

### Chapter 1: The Crin'tiki Gambit, or: Fliit's Big Night

**You're behind the control station of your ship, two hours out from the planet Kanaloa.  Why are you headed there?**  
[A] This shipment of reverse-ratcheting rotors won't deliver itself  
[B] This shipment of black market intoxicants won't deliver itself  
[C] Gonna lay low there until the heat from the Crin'tik job dies down  
[D] Your buddy Anton says that he has a lead on where The Great Gilded Jackal is hidden, but he'll only talk in person  
[E] You're ferrying 3 Crin'tiki missionaries who are ready to start spreading the True Message of the Crying God  
[F] Something else

**Who's in the cockpit with you?**  
[A] Your ex-spouse and the half owner of the ship  
[B] Vinnie, a rock monster who's your closest friend  
[C] SPINTO, a robot you salvaged who's not currently broken  
[D] Overseer 171X, your robotic parole officer  
[E] Your summer intern  
[F] No one--you're a loner and always will be  
[G] Someone else  

**Also, what's your name?  What's your ship's name?  What's something that everyone knows about Kanaloa?  What's a rumor you've heard about Kanaloa?**

_[A] [B].  Name: Ethanicus.  What everyone knows (or maybe this is just a rumor): Don't go to the dark side of Kanaloa.  No one gave a ship name._

**You check your ledger yet again: After fuel costs and various sundries, you still stand to make a tidy profit on these reverse-ratcheting rotors.  For the first time in months, you're comfortable.  You could even start paying off one of your creditors, if, you know, you wanted to.**

**Vinnie seems to be thinking the same thing.  He rumbles, "I heard there's this place on Kanaloa that makes fantastic grilled klyxe.  We should check it out after the drop off."**

**How are you planning on spending your credits?**  
[A] Pay back one of your creditors (but which one?)  
[B] Invest in an upgrade for your ship  
[C] Blow it all on booze and klyxe meat, apparently  
[D] Something else  

_[B]_

**The drop off happens without a hitch.  Say what you want about the Kanaloans (and your uncle's been known to, once he's got some gin in him), but they have spaceport logistics down to a science.  You and Vinnie settle in for a meal at a midrange steakhouse, and between courses you browse ads for new ship parts.  You think you've narrowed it down to:**  
[A] Larger cargo bay (+50% carrying capacity)  
[B] Faster engines (+25% range and fuel efficiency)  
[C] Some actual defensive weapons, not just the fake blasters you're surprised have fooled anybody  
[D] Something else  

**Louie is leaned back in his seat, grinning broadly.  "We should eat like that every day, E."  He suppresses a small belch.  "So do you have anything lined up next?"  In fact, you just saw a job posting that looked promising...**  
[A] A xenoarchaeologist needs an escort to explore some ruins on the dark side of the planet  
[B] A Kanaloan farmer needs someone to haul his broken down grainulator to the Salvage Zone  
[C] Three...let's say "seamstresses"...need passage to Altair before the next Holovid Convention starts  
[D] A holy excavator for The Church of the Crying God has uncovered a relic that needs to be transported back to Crin'tik  
[E] Something else  

_[B] [D]_

**When you see the relic, you wish you had splurged for the larger cargo space--if it were much larger you'd have to leave Vinnie behind to make space.  The holy excavator is quite animated.  "We think it's the pod--well, what's left of it--that Apostle Fliit took when he set out to the stars to spread the True Message.  He was only the third Apostle to leave the planet, you know."  (You did not, in fact, know this.)**

**"This is back when Apostles would place themselves inside a pod to be fired into space, never to return," the excavator continues.  "What a life!"  Looking closer, you can see the pieces of the relic could be formed into a kind of capsule.  The outside is rough and worn, but in the interior you can, just faintly, see some remnants of Crin'tiki script.  It's hard to believe anyone would choose to be strapped into one of these things, and harder to believe they ever actually reached a destination, but you're not one to argue with the Church.  At least, not while they're putting up the credits.**

**With the new engines, the trip to Crin'tik should take a little over 2 days.  The holy excavator--Nin'in'in--chatters away through most of it.  He gladly answers your questions about...**  
[A] Crin'tiki culture  
[B] Rumors of corruption inside the Church  
[C] The brewing schisms between Antemessagarians and Postmessagarians  
[D] Something else  

_[C]_

**The crux, as you gather, is that Antemessagarians believe that the True Message was embedded in the universe at the time of its creation, whereas the Postmessagarians believe that it did not exist until the Crying God chose to impart Vav'v with the knowledge.  Antemessagarianism was always a fringe belief until about 80 years ago, when scholars began to claim they could find evidence of the Message in detailed analysis of their star's stellar emissions, and that, crucially, available historical records suggest that the same patterns would have been there pre-Impartation.  The Antemessagarian faction is gaining influence, but are still virtually shut out from the rather conservative Synod of 36.  Some think that a schism is actually the safest course, as there are young Antemessagarians who seem to be setting the groundwork for an all-out Holy War.**

**When you're a day out from Crin'tik, you get the last message in the universe you wanted to see.  It's from Big Susan Valdman.   "Ah, Ethanicus, I can't believe my luck."  You roll your eyes--at least the banks you're in debt to don't pretend to be your friend.  "I was just thinking about how I helped you out of that scrape in Altair--for which you still haven't repaid me--and now here we both are heading for Crin'tik at the same time!  I'm sure you were just about to get in touch, to let me know you were around, because you certainly couldn't have thought that our business was concluded.  It just so happens there's something you could do for me, so that we're all squared away."  You know that this won't be good, but you'd really like to be out from under Big Susan's thumb.  What does she want you to do?**  
[A] Deliver a package to a space station run by the interstellar mining conglomerate DUK.  "I'm sure I don't even have to say this, but it'd be a good idea not to look in this package."  
[B] Make sure a member of the Synod of 36 isn't able to make it to the next meeting.  "Keep him busy, take him off-world, break his ship, I don't really care how."  
[C] Plant a listening device in the office of Crin'tiki Minister of Trade and Logistics.  "I've already set up a meeting, you just need to show up."  
[D] Something else  
...  
[E] It doesn't matter what Big Susan wants, you've spent too long building a legitimate business and you're not going to let her compromise it.  

_[B]_

**While Nin'in'in is asleep, you show Vinnie the message.  "At least she's not asking us to kill him."  You raise an eyebrow.  "What?  If she wanted him dead, she wouldn't ask you.  She's got guys for that."  Vinnie has a point--Big Susan must think there's some non-violent solution possible.  You hope.**

**The next morning, you try to probe Nin'in'in for information.  "Do you know someone in the Synod named Fliit?"**

**Nin'in'in beams.  "I worked with him on a big project a few years back!  Great guy!  He's young--only joined the Synod about two years ago, I think--and he's a real reformer.  One of the most Antemessagarian-friendly voices in the Synod.  Of course, I don't think those rumors are true at all."**

**What are the rumors?**

_Akumu: That Fliit frequents coffee speakeasies. Coffee is of course against the Message._

_In response to a question about the Messagarian dispute: The Postmessagarian/Antemessagarian dispute is a doctrinal matter in the Church that doesn't really make sense, or need to make sense, to outsiders.  I'm sure that if I were religious, I could give a real-world example of something similar.  However, the dispute about the dating of the Message doesn't have (much) effect on the actual content; both camps agree on the core tenets, which includes forbidding coffee and other heated beverages.  Why does the Message include any stance on heated beverages at all?  Only the Crying God would know._

**Nin'in'in is all too happy to spill the beans (har har) about Fliit's coffee habit.  He even helpfully shares the location of The Green Veranda, one of the biggest coffee speakeasies in the capital.  After you finish unloading the relic and collected your payment from the Church, you and Vinnie shake Nin'in'in's talon and head off there.  After some discreet poking around, you manage to find Fliit.  You can tell from the glow around his mandible that he's already a few cups in.  How do you want to handle this?**  
[A] Tell him you'll release the pictures of him drinking coffee unless he skips the Synod meeting  
[B] Keep this party rolling for so long he misses the meeting  
[C] Offer him 2,000 credits to miss the meeting  
[D] Sabotage his ship so he's stranded here  
[E] Something else  

_[B]_

**Ah yeah.  Tonight you're going to fight until you see the sunlight, like your grandfather used to say.  Fliit seems apprehensive at first, but after buying a few rounds he becomes much more receptive.  Still, around 2 AM he begins to flag.  "This has been so fun, you guys," he says, "but I have this thing in the morning, and I can't show up--" he gestures to his mandible, currently incandescent from the caffeine "--glowing.  I gotta head home.  But call me next time you're in town, all right?  Let me give you my number."  This will be the third or fourth time he's given you his subwave number.  What do you do?**  
[A] Tempt him into hitting the Crin'tiki strip clubs  
[B] Get him a coffee "for the road" laced with a sedative  
[C] Tell him you'll release the pictures of him drinking coffee unless he skips the Synod meeting  
[D] Ask to crash at his place, where you'll find some way to keep him from the meeting  
[E] Something else  

_[D]_

**"Oh, you're so sweet, but I'm not into humans," Fliit says.  Then he looks at Vinnie.  "Or, uh, Ruamokans.  And definitely not threeways.  Well--no, no."**

**It takes a bit, but you manage to convince that it wasn't a pass, and you really do need a place to sleep for the night.**

**His apartment is clean and decorated very stylishly; as he explained, he's only here a few weeks out of every year.  "Just let me change into something more comfortable," he says as he steps into his bedroom, but he doesn't come out.  After several minutes, Vinnie pushes the door open to reveal Fliit passed out face down on his bed.**

**What now?**  
[A] Turn off his alarm clock so he oversleeps  
[B] Steal his keys and his subwave, so he can't go to the meeting and can't call for help  
[C] Go sabotage his ship  
[D] Steal all his ceremonial robes so he won't have the proper attire for the Synod meeting (Vinnie looks skeptical when you mention that idea.  "Nin'in'in told us all about the Synod dress code," you explain.  "All.  About.  It.")  
[E] Lock him in the bedroom and barricade the door  
[F] Something else  

_[A] and a version of [D]--get his robes dirty/unpresentable, but don't steal them entirely._

**The perfect plan.  Step 1: Turn off Fliit's alarm clock.  Step 2: Stain and hide his robes.  The biggest hitch is the argument you and Vinnie get into about whether a plan can have only two steps.**

**You're awakened by Fliit's panicked screeching the next morning.  "I can't find my rooooooobes," he squeals.  You check your watch--the meeting's set to begin in 45 minutes.**

**"Oh, you mean those blue and yellow dealies?" Vinnie asks.  "Uh, yeah, I think I saw you put them in your icebox."**

**"Oh, right," you add.  "I said that being a Synod member must be cool, and you said it was cooler than cool, and we all laughed."**

**Fliit looks skeptical, but he's not in the mood to argue, and you get the sense this isn't the first time he's had no memories of the night before.  He removes the robes, only to scream again when he sees they're smeared with... He pauses.  "Is this pudding?!"**

**"Uh, yeah," you say.  "Don't you remember going to that pudding bar?"**

**"This is a disaster," Fliit moans.  You offer to help him clean the robes, but it's no use.  "I definitely can't make the meeting now."  He composes himself.  "I'll have to call in sick.  Thanks again for the fantastic night, guys, but it's probably time for you two to leave."**

_Commenters start to feel guilty, leading I Don't Know to suggest: Vinnie flashes back to a Neewolloh years ago and remembers a suspiciously accurate Synod garb costume Vinnie used to wear_

**Vinnie's old Neewolloh costume?  That's ridiculous.  It wouldn't even fit.  But now that you mention it, there was a costume shop down the street from Fliit's apartment...**

**You're torn, though.  While you liked Fliit a lot, you're not sure you want to be on Big Susan's bad side.**  
[A] So Fliit missed one meeting.  It's not the end of the world.  
[B] Screw Susan!  Fliit's going to be there with bells on!  (Bells are also part of the garb.)  

_[B]_

**Somewhat amazingly, it comes together, with you helping freshen up Fliit and get him into his fake robes while Vinnie drives Fliit's ship 30 clicks over the limit.  "Thank you so much, guys!" is the last thing he says to you, before rushing into the Synod meeting just as the starting bells chime.**

**To your surprise, Big Susan takes it in stride.  Well, for her, anyway.  "I'm very disappointed to hear that," her message reads.  "And you must know that this means our business is not concluded.  But, I suppose it serves me right for trusting you two to handle what must have been such a complicated operation.  So here's what you can do to make things square..."**  
[A] Deliver a package to a space station run by the interstellar mining conglomerate DUK.  "I'm sure I don't even have to say this, but it'd be a good idea not to look in this package."  
[B] Plant a listening device in the office of Crin'tiki Minister of Trade and Logistics.  "I can get you in the door, but you need to do the rest."  
[C] "Spend two weeks as the practice dummies for some of my associates trying to learn self-defense.  Oh, and also, I'll take your ship."  
[D] Something else  

_Bean: He was too fast for us... He just Fliited away_

**"For the last time, Vinnie, no, I'm not going to say that!  Big Susan's mad enough as is!"**

_ncrecc: ohh don't want [to give up the ship], you just got the cargo upgrade. tell susan you'll spend three weeks as the practice dummies, but she doesn't get to take your ship_

**Big Susan's response comes quick.  "Three weeks, and you pay for the food and medical supplies you use, and we've got a deal."**

**Three extremely painful weeks later, Big Susan is shaking your hand and telling you to get the hell out of her compound.  You're broke again, but at least you're squared away with one of the scarier women in the sector.**


### Chapter 2: Ice Ice Baby


**The time in Big Susan's compound wasn't a total loss.  (Some of her guards were getting really good at self-defense, for one thing.)  Also...**  
[A] One of the doctors took pity on you and promised to recommend you to her friends looking for a courier.  
[B] You overheard whispers of one of Big Susan's upcoming scores, which you're sure the police would be interested in  
[C] You overheard whispers of one of Big Susan's upcoming scores, which you're sure the _other_ criminal kingpins in the sector would be interested in  
[D] One of the security guards sold you a treasure map  
[E] You stole the codes for some of Big Susan's many illicit  bank accounts, which you can use once enough time has passed  
[F] Something else  

_[D]_

**Vinnie wasn't happy that you decided to spend the last of your credits on a treasure map, but you supported him during his cargo pants phase, so he owes you.  According to the map, you need to go to...**  
[A] The jungles of Zervin VI  
[B] The deserts of Zervin VI  
[C] The frozen tundras of Zervin VI  
[D] The city in the center of Zervin VI  
[E] Someplace else  

_[C]_

**"Run this by me again," Vinnie asks, for the third or fourth time, when you're a few hours out from Zervin VI.**

**"A few millennia ago, there was a civilization here--best name we have for them is just the Pre-Zervinians.  Best anyone can figure, they went to war with themselves, and one of their doomsday weapons altered the climate, freezing the planet and killing them all off.  A sad cautionary tale of the futility of war, right?"  Vinnie nods.**

**"Anyway, xenoarchaeologists have excavated what they could, but they mostly stuck to the relatively temperate equatorial region--they know there are big finds in the north and south, but the ice sheets are too thick to penetrate, at least with your normal xenoarchaeology grants.  They figure they'll wait another few hundred years for the planet to warm some more.  It's not like the ruins are going anywhere.  That guard from Big Susan's, though--"**

**"Diana."**

**"Right, Diana, she's got a sister--Kate--who does survey analysis for DUK, scanning planets from the atmosphere to try to detect where there's high concentrations of valuable ores, places where The Duke should set up shop.  What she noticed was that there's a point on the planet's southern continent where the ice looks thin, thinner than anyone would expect, and underneath seems hollow, I guess?  That once you get past the ice, there's open air.  Kate tried to get DUK excited, but you know they don't give a shit about ancient relics, just trilidium ore.  So the deal is that we go in, and if we find anything, 20% goes to her."**

**"And how do we get through the ice?  We can't afford a big icebreaker."**

**"If Kate's data is right, we shouldn't need it.  It's thin enough that we can just hover the ship directly over the ice for a few hours, and the heat from the engines should be enough to break through."**

**"And the fuel costs are going to be...?"**

**"Not a problem compared to what we're going to find down there!"**

**Vinnie groans.  "And what, exactly, do you expect us to find?"**

**"According to the archaeological surveys, this should be the site of a Pre-Zervinian city that specialized in..."**  
[A] "Incredible art--we're talking exquisite, gem-coated sculptures and the like."  
[B] "Scientific research and robotics.  There's some evidence that the Pre-Zervinians had actually gotten self-aware robots to work, not just flip out and kill everyone."  
[C] "Historical research.  This was once the home to the civilization's central archives.  Historians and the like would be pouring over what we find for decades."  
[D] "Weapons.  Out of date, but it's not like laser gun technology has changed that much.  And they'd be untraceable."  
[E] "Gold.  Legends say there should be several tons of solid gold bricks buried under the central bank."  
[F] Something else  

_[B]_

**It looks like the scans were right--after you punch through the ice sheet on top, you're able to descend into a canyon.  There are doors along the cliff faces, so the buildings must have been carved directly into the rocks.  "Probably for security," Vinnie says.  "Hard to destroy a building when it's sheltered by a thousand tons of rock."  Not knowing where to start, you head for the closest door.  Naturally, the servos to open haven't worked in centuries, but you and Vinnie are able to pry it open without too much effort.**

**Inside, despite the dust and decay, you'd recognize a corporate reception area anywhere.  It's a large, open space, with curved walls, and what you think was once a desk immediately opposite the door.  Behind the desk, your flashlights illuminate a giant, faded painting of three cat people proudly standing around what looks like an upside down garbage can laced with lights and dials.  What looks like a passageway to more offices is completed blocked off by a section of collapsed ceiling, and there appears to have once been an elevator to a lower level, but you're not particularly in the mood to enter a pitch black 80-foot shaft.  The one door that still seems in working shape leads to a series of ramps going down.**

**The area below is huge--this room must cover several acres.  Even after all this time, there are still a few partitions standing, and traces of paint along the floor, so you can get a sense of how it was subdivided into smaller areas on kind of an ad hoc basis.  You wonder if this is where they built the robots, but Vinnie points out that there doesn't seem to be any heavy machinery here.  This wasn't a factory floor.  "It might have been a testing area.  Or maybe where they wrote the software."**

**You slowly work your way through the room, looking for anything of value.  You find some papers, faded and water-logged and nearly crumbling in your fingers, marked up with what you recognize from the research on the flight over as Pre-Zervinian script, that you think an expert might be able to translate.  There are also what might be circuitboards, corroded but not completely gone; from what you can tell, the circuity is familiar enough that you could hazard a guess at how it works, and with time possibly reconstruct it yourself.  "Hey, Vinnie, do you have space in your pack," you start, but he shushes you, and you notice that he's standing completely still.**

**"Do you hear that?" Vinnie whispers?  You don't, but you know Ruamokans have more sensitive hearing.  "I think there's something over there," and he gestures with his light to a pile of debris about 40 yards away.  Your hand moves to the blaster in your holster, and you start to regret that you didn't log more hours in the firing simulator.**

**Do you...**  
[A] Take this as an excuse to leave.  There are museums who'd probably be willing to give you a few credits for what you've found so far.  
[B] Inch toward the debris, with Vinnie flanking, to try to get a better sense of what's there?  
[C] Just start blasting away  
[D] Keep exploring down here, but being sure to never get closer to the debris pile and certainly never letting the pile get between you and the ramp out.  
[E] Something else  

_[E] Give the debris a friendly greeting_

**"Hello there, ice monster!  Nice day, isn't it?" you shout cheerfully.  Vinnie gives you a look.  "I'm just trying to be polite."  There's no response.**

_[B]_

**You and Vinnie walk closer.  When you're about 30 feet away, you're able to hear some scrambling about, and you can make out signs of movement, so you stop, and signal for Vinnie to do the same.  After a few seconds, an adorable little ice lizard, about the size of your palm, scoots out from under the debris.**

**And then, a few seconds later, another lizard, the size of a refrigerator, with spikes jutting out from all over its body, leaps from the debris pile and swallows the cute lizard whole.  "Man, I hate it when that happens!" Vinnie says, as the beast roars.**

**You can:**  
[A] Open fire  
[B] Turn and run  
[C] Something else (and you're really hoping you can come up with something better)  

_ncrecc asks: Is Vinnie slower than you?  Answer: Normally yes, but you're wearing bulky cold weather clothes while he can handle the climate basically unencumbered, so you're not sure._

_Commenters decide to offer the lizard some food_


**Slowly, fearing that a sudden movement will cause the lizard to attack, you remove your pack and reach inside, pulling out a few energy bars.  You toss them a few feet ahead of the beast.  It steps forward, gives them a sniff, then grabs them with its mouth and skitters back under the debris.  You're safe, for now, but also hungry.  You and Vinnie resume searching the ruins, but only the area nearest the door, as you try very hard not to think about the various noises you now can't help but hear.**

**Two hours in, you find what looks like a large safe or lockbox, about five feet to a side.  It's sturdy enough that it's held firm since being abandoned, but whatever the locking mechanism had been it's not longer an issue; you're able to pry the door open even without Vinnie's help.  When you do so, there's a faint plop, and looking closer reveals that the box was rigged with an explosive to destroy its contents if someone tried to force entry, but like nearly everything else in this place, time has rendered it moot.**

**Inside is more of the same, but in better condition--papers that aren't water damaged, circuit boards that are mostly intact.  This should be more than enough to make up for the costs in coming here and justify future expeditions by actual academics.  Inside there's also what looks like a complicated garbage can, and it takes you a second to realize you recognize it from the picture at the entrance--this must have been one of the robots being designed or tested here, a remarkably intact specimen.  Your packs full, you schlep the machine along with everything else you've found back to your ship.**

**That night you spend some time examining what you've recovered.  You're not an expert, but you know a bit about electronics and such from keeping your ship running for all these years, and you think you have a general sense for how the circuit boards would work, at least making an educated guess for how the parts would correspond to what you're familiar with.  You're even bold enough to try removing one of the robot's outer plates to get a better look at what's inside.  The insides are remarkably well-preserved--the Pre-Zervinians built this thing to last.  In fact, it looks like if you jury-rig a replacement for the main power supply, you should be able to start it up.**  
[A] This is an incredibly bad idea  
[B] This is an incredibly bad idea, but you're going to do it anyway  

_[B]_

**You rig up the connection to the ship's power supply and activate it.  Amazingly, it seems to work: A few of the lights on the robot's case flicker on, and you can hear grinding inside as long-dormant electronics return to life.  After a few minutes, a warbly, distorted fanfare plays.  The robot rotates slightly, until (you assume) it's looking at you, and it says, "▬◦▨✜✃▯".  (You assume it's speech, as a light, approximately where a both would be, flickers in time with the sounds.)  You respond...**  
[A] "My name is Ethanicus.  What should I call you?"  
[B] "Robot, obey me!"  
[C] "Begin diagnostic mode."  
[D] "▬◦▨✜✃▯"  
[E] Something else  

_[E] "hey babe how you doin'"_

**After a beat, its mouth light flickers from yellow to red, and it says, you think more slowly, "▾ ⍨ ⏂ ▬ ◦ ▨ ✜ ✃ ▯."**  
[A] Try flirting some more  
[B] Attempt to repeat "▾⍨⏂▬◦▨✜✃▯" back to it  
[C] Press the parts of its case that look like buttons, flip the parts that look like switches  
[D] Power it off  
[E] "Robot, enter English language mode."  
[F] Something else  

_[E]_

**Its mouth gets redder, and it repeats, "▾ ⍨ ⏂ ▬ ◦ ▨ ✜ ✃ ▯."**

**Yeah, you're not sure why you thought this millennia-old robot from a species that never left its home planet would have an English mode.  You look at Vinnie for advice, but before either of you think of something to try, all of the robots lights turn red.  "✥✍⎪⏗⍠✜⍩," it says, you think somehow more menacingly than before.  Two blade emerge from its side panels, and it starts to spin quickly, becoming a deadly top!**

**At least, you think that's what it's trying.  One of the side panels is stuck shut, so you can just hear the grinding of servos as it tries to force the blade through, and whatever mechanism allowed it to spin quickly is similarly kaput.  It limply falls to one side and does a kind of jerky dance.**

**"⌡❒⍇➰⎪⏟!" it...screams, you think?**

_Bean: "▬◦▨✜✃▯"_

**You're not sure what you're saying, and you *are* sure that you're not saying it correctly, but whatever it was is apparently good enough.  The lights turn a mix of yellows and greens, it retracts its blades, and it stops jerking around.  After a minute to be sure that it's calmed, you set it upright again.**

**However, you notice it's getting hot to the touch.  Not wanting to risk the machine further, you power it down, but the next step seems obvious.**  
[A] Get to work repairing its motors and such  
[B] Contact some experts in Pre-Zervinian culture to try to translate it  
[C] Open it up and try to reverse engineer whatever's in there  
[D] Assume it's haunted and bury it in the planet's ground, hopefully never to emerge  
[E] Something else  

_[B]_

**You set the robot aside for now, and spend the next day filling the rest of your cargohold with materials liberated from some of the other buildings in the area, but you don't find anything nearly as intriguing as the robot.  Once you're ready to depart, you head to Zervin III (or, as the inhabitants there call it, just Zerv).  The Zervians were just leaving the iron age when the people of Zervin VI wiped themselves out, so they never made direct contact, but they've been able to collect enough detritus, ancient broadcasts and the like, to have made a pretty good go at translating the language.  You have a contact at North Zerv University...**  
[A] A former business partner of your father  
[B] A victim of one of your mother's scams  
[C] Vinnie's ex-wife  
[D] Someone you met before you both washed out of the Federated Space Patrol  
[E] The person you bought your ship from, in fact  
[F] Someone else  

**Also, what's this person's name?  What's something everyone who meets them knows about them?  What's something that they prefer to keep secret?**

_[C] vinnie's ex-wife, an ice elemental (or something close to it).  She'd prefer people don't know about her former flame, who's yes-and'd into being a fire elemental._

**”Are you sure Teenu’s going be OK with this?” you ask Vinnie. “There’s no tension between you?”**

**“Nah,” Vinnie says, then takes a big pause. You know what’s coming.**

**“Please don’t say it,” you mutter.**

**Vinnie doesn’t listen. “She’s cool!” He gives you a real shit-eating grin.**

**Teenu meets you when you land at North Zerv University.  "Vinnie, honey," as she gives your co-pilot a hug.  "It's been too long."  She then steps aside to reveal another Zervian ("ice elemental" is not the preferred nomenclature).  "This is Dr. Blix from our xenoarchaeology department.  He's here to appraise your find."**

**Dr. Blix goes through the contents of your shuttle carefully.  He seems particularly excited by what appears to be a greeting card of some kind, as well as maybe a government safety manual.  "This really gives a better sense of how the Pre-Zervinians actually lived," he explains.  "Much more so than the technical documentation."**

**You eventually strike a deal: The University will pay 12,000 credits for everything except the robot and the coordinates of the excavation site; you also negotiate that you'll be specifically thanked in papers published based on analysis material over the next ten years.  You'll loan the robot to the university for further study, with an eye on translating its speech, and you'll give back 3,000 credits if they're able to refurbish it, get it into working order and install an English language mode.  You, Vinnie, and the Doctor gladly shake hands and sign the paperwork for the Bursar.**

### Chapter 3: The Case of the Misappropriated Funds

**Teenu invites you and Vinnie to have dinner at her place.  The food is wonderful, but Teenu seems on edge through it all.  After the meal, she finally tells you that...**  
[A] Char, her fire elemental ex, is trying to extort money from her  
[B] She thinks someone in her department has been sabotaging her work  
[C] She's heard rumors that someone in the university administration has been embezzling funds, and the school's on the brink of collapse  
[D] Her baby sister, Tunee, has joined the True Devotees of the Laughing God (the much less popular, much more cult-like Crin'tiki church)  
[E] Something else  
...and she could really use your and Vinnie's help  

_[C]_

**"So, I don't know," Teenu says.  "There's no smoking gun, just small things--new staff isn't being hired, machines aren't being upgraded, things like that.  The administration says we're flush with credits, but they don't act like it.  And people have been talking."**

**You're uncertain.  "Isn't there someone, you know, more qualified to figure this out?"**

**Teenu sighs.  "Probably, but...You've heard my 'evidence'.  It's thin.  It's not like I can go to the Education Council and get a hearing.  All I'm saying is, poke around a bit.  Flip a few icebergs.  See if anything turns up."**

**"I don't know--" you start, but Vinnie cuts you off.**

**"Of course, Teenu.  We'd be glad to."**

**Her face gets colder, which you have to remind yourself is how Zervians look when they're happy.  So how do you want to handle this?**  
[A] Tell people we're from the Federated Space Education Council here to perform an audit  
[B] Tell people we're journalists hoping to do a glowing profile of the North Zerv University administration  
[C] Tell people we're from Federate Space Threat Assessment, here to investigate various unsavory allegations  
[D] Tell people we're two space truckers who recently made a major find on Zervin VI and now are just hanging around asking questions  
[E] Something else  

**Teenu also laid out the most likely culprits:**  
* **The Chancellor (K'Sokher): She was formerly a muckety muck with Altair Pharmaceuticals.  She had no connection to the university before being appointed Chancellor by the Board of Trustees three years ago, and has ruffled feathers with an antagonistic approach to the faculty.**  
* **The Provost (Anttu): He's never known life outside of the university, starting as a Zervian history student five decades ago, staying on for a graduate degree, then a professorship, department head, Dean, and now Provost.  Very committed to the ideals of academic freedom, open office hours, and the three-martini lunch.  Reportedly rather unhappy to have been passed over for the Chanellor position.**  
* **The Bursar (Maguaq): Has a mental condition that makes him believe he's a robot, but he's good with figures, so the rest of the staff allows it.**  
* **The Student Representative (Killa): North Zerv University has a tradition where the student body elects a pupil each year to represent their interests to the administration; far from ceremonial, this person is considered to have weight equivalent to any department head.  Currently the position is held by Killa, a Computer Science student known (only behind her back) as "Killer" due to her incredible ambition; in an unprecedented move, this is actually her second year in the role.**  

_[B]_

**It doesn't take much work to set up some fake credentials showing that you're a writer for The Daily Nebula and Vinnie is your assistant/scribe.  (You and Vinnie flipped for which one got to be in charge.)  This won't stand up to strict scrutiny, but it's enough to get you in the door.  K'Sokher is absolutely thrilled to meet with you in her office.**

**"As you're certainly aware, under my leadership, North Zerv University is spearheading a radical restructuring of the university qua university.  Our model is built around the pinnacle virtues of 1) greater faculty output, 2) enhanced student experience, and 3) corporate partnership.  We ask everyone, students and teachers alike, to contribute to solving real-world problems; for example, DUK is working with a team of our geology undergraduates to improve their ore detection process.  It's win-win-win: The students get actual experience, DUK gets better results, and NZU is paid a percentage of any revenue earned by patents filed as a result of our research."**

**K'Sokher goes on to describe how her time with Altair Pharmaceuticals inspired her believe that universities could be run more efficiently, spends a bit of time running down her predecessor, Balivilmiktorgrunnedisa, for his "ivory tower mentality" and lack of interest in the bottom line, talks about the 600 new units of luxury dormitories under construction (expected to be open to students within 6 years), and boasts that she's been able to achieve all of this "despite the opposition of some entrenched stakeholders who--I shouldn't say this, but, frankly, they're fat and happy after getting a free ride for the last several decades and don't want to accept that the world has changed."**

_Around here, I change the interface for this incredibly talky chapter.  I would provide a list of things to possibly ask about (more or less anything that's come up in the text, plus people were encouraged to ask about anything else I didn't think of) as well as other people they could try talking to.  For example:_

**UNLOCKED KEYWORDS:**  
Altair Pharmaceuticals  
Anttu (the Provost)  
Balivilmiktorgrunnedisa  
Corporate Partnerships  
"Entrenched stakeholders"  
Killa (the Student Representative)  
Luxury dormitories  
Maguaq (the Bursar)  
Rumors of embezzlement  

**PEOPLE TO QUESTION:**  
K'Sokher (the Chancellor) **<-- YOU ARE HERE**  
Anttu (the Provost)  
Maguaq (the Bursar)  
Killa (the Student Representative)  
Teenu (Vinnie's ex-wife)  

_For this chapter, if you don't see a prompt, assume that I gave readers a choice like this._

**On Altair Pharmaceuticals: K'Sokher outlines how she battled her way to be the company's Vice President of Business Affairs and all of her heroic successes, including reducing payroll expense increase by over 30%.  ("So the costs still went up?" you ask.  "Yes, but much more slowly than projected.")**

**On Balivilmiktorgrunnedisa and the "entrenched stakeholders": "Oh, I shouldn't have said that.  Please don't quote me.  'On the record', everyone's been fantastic, and we're all working together to achieve the greatest possible success for our institution."**

**On the luxury dormitories: "State of the art accomodations.  Every suite includes a small kitchen and a private bathroom--the days of dreading the community showers are over!  The complex will also include a top-of-the-line fitness center, and a dining hall, where we're in negotiations to have Elinda Milja--yes, from the subwave broadcasts--as head chef.  You can see the site on the eastern campus; the plan is to start laying foundation within the month."**

**On Anttu: K'Sokher's face brightens (which, remember, is a bad thing for a Zervian).  "Oh, good old Anttu," she says through a fake smile.  "With all of those years of experience, you'd think he'd be eager to try something new!  Ha, ha, ha.  But just between us, he wouldn't know a good idea if it bit him the ass.  Off the record!  Off the record!"**

**On Maguaq: "You're not going to talk to him for this article, are you?  You know about his, uh..." She gestures at her head, then moves her arms like a robot.**

**On Killa: "Oh, she's one of a kind, that Killer--Killa!  When I was a student, I was more into the, glug-glug-glug," she says, pantomiming drinking straight for a bottle, "and the kiss-kiss-kiss, but not Killa!  Always getting involved, asking questions, starting arguments."  She stops and forces on another smile.  "She's a real gem, and it wouldn't be the same without her!"**

**On the embezzlement rumors: Any joy drains from K'Sokher's face.  "I'm certain I have no idea what you're talking about."  Then the mask is back up.  "Is there something else you wanted to ask me?"**

_Go talk to Killa, the Student Representative_

**You've arranged a meeting with Killa next.  You assumed it would be in a coffee shop or maybe her dorm, but she surprises you by suggesting her office instead.  The Student Representative gets one, in the same building as the  Chancellor's, but tucked in the dankest corner of the subbasement.  It's barely larger than the desk bolted to one wall, but Killa has personalized it, kind of--there's a poster of former Federated Space President Hooches bin Cooper taped over the desk.  "You're writing about Chancellor K'Sokher?  Like, I think it's soooo great we have this kick-ass woman as the Chancellor, but honestly?  The students have, like, some concerns."  She talks about how the corporate partnerships amount to basically unpaid labor from students, notes that beloved junior faculty members were being dismissed without cause, and complains that the administration is ignoring the student-driven push for the university to boycott Kanaloan goods ("The way they treat so-called 'Darksiders' is just, like, grossly immoral, and it's like the administration doesn't even care").**

**On Killa: "My favorite subject!  JK, can you imagine?"  She lays out her life plan: Graduate this year as valedictorian, get a job with a Big 3 tech company, work there for seven years, building up connections and potential donors, then run for a seat in the Federated Space Parliament.  "And from there, who knows?" she says; you suspect *she* does, but she's learned to stop saying the next steps out loud.**

**On luxury dorms: "It's, like, just so wasteful.  With the money being spent on that project, we could, like, completely eradicate Crin'tiki measels and save thousands of lives.  The whole project seems *super* sketchy.  Like, my friend Biri, she's in the architecture department, and she says these costs are way out of wack.  There are construction firms here that should be able to do the same work at half the cost."  She pauses.  "Still, that fitness center sounds lit.  I might have to re-enroll just to live there.  LOL."**

**On K'Sokher: "So, I totally admire her, and it's great to have this strong, confident woman running the school.  But also, it's like, she's running the school like it's a business, and it's not a business?  It's a school?  And fostering a positive learning environment should be more important than the bottom line."  She explains that one of the first things K'Sokher did when she became Chancellor was to sack a quarter of the junior faculty members to reduce costs.  "And like, some of those professors were suuuuper good at their job.  I loved Professor Fror's seminar, but he was fired, and then the next year he proved that quantum dynamic queueing systems can't run better than PXX time, and now he's on the shortlist for the Lebon Prize!"**

**On Anttu: Her face scrunches up.  "That guy is gross.  Like, you didn't hear it from me, but it's like the only reason he even still teaches his one seminar per year is to find girls to perv on.  And some girls go for it!  OMG.  People say he's super pissed that he's not the Chancellor, but if ask me, the Board made the right choice."**

**On Maguaq: "I think it's so great that the university supports such cognitive diversity in the staff.  And he's so good at his job, and, like, super sweet, and a really good listener."**

**Vinnie looks up.  "Uh, do you have a crush on Maguaq?"**

**"What?  No!  Shut up!"**

**On the embezzlement rumors: "Sure, I've heard rumors, and I get it, if we're so rich, why are there so many cutbacks?  But, like, wouldn't Maguaq have said something?"**

_People want to know more about Maguaq's condition._

**On Maguaq: "So, the word is, he was a student in the experimental physics department when they were doing research on, like, molecular accelerators or whatever, but I guess some of their math was off or the accelerator wasn't secured properly, and it exploded!  He pushed the professor out of the way of some debris, but he ended up with a piece of metal embedded in his brain, and he was in a coma for, like, weeks.  When he woke up, he was convinced he was a robot, and no one could talk him out of it.  Don't even try, he flips out or something.  He also really likes numbers now?  Like, more than before.  So the school let him enroll in the Accounting program, and he was so awesome at it they hired him.  At least, that's what I heard."**

_Go talk to Maguaq, the Bursar_

**The Bursar's office is completely empty except for a filing cabinet, a desk with a computer and a well-ordered stacks of receipts, and the chair where Maguaq is sitting.  "GREETINGS," he says, his voice monotone but with a strange, sing-song-y cadence.  "I AM MAGUAQ THE BURSAR.  IT IS A"--he pauses for a tick, as though some internal calculation needs to be completed--"PLEASURE TO MEET YOU."  Unlike the other people you've talked to, it doesn't seem like he's going to volunteer much information on his own, so you'd better start asking questions.**

**On K'Sokher: "SINCE THE BEGINNING OF CHANCELLOR K'SOKHER'S TERM, GROSS REVENUE HAS INCREASED BY 14%, AND EXPENDITURES HAVE INCREASED BY 2%, LEADING TO A BALANCE OF APPROXIMATELY 3.71 BILLION CREDITS, A"--another pause--"23-YEAR HIGH."**

**On revenue increase: "CORPORATE PARTNERSHIPS ACCOUNT FOR 8.2 PERCENTAGE POINTS OF INCREASE.  GREATER ENROLLMENT AND HIGHER TUITION ACCOUNT FOR 4.5 PERCENTAGE POINTS.  NO OTHER FACTOR ACCOUNTS FOR GREATER THAN 1 PERCENTAGE POINT."**

**On expenditure increase: "REDUCED SPENDING ON FACULTY SALARIES LEAD TO A 6.5% DECREASE IN EXPENDITURES, IN LINE WITH CHANCELLOR K'SOKHER'S GOALS.  HOWEVER, THE COST OF DEVELOPMENT AND CONSTRUCTION FOR THE NEW DORMITORIES GREATLY EXCEEDED PROJECTIONS, RESULTING IN THE [pause] SMALL INCREASE IN TOTAL EXPENDITURES."**

**On the luxury dormitories: "THE VIILIAS MEMORIAL STUDENT RESIDENCE IS PROJECTED TO BE COMPLETED WITHIN SEVEN YEARS AND WILL CONTAIN 595 UNITS OF STUDENTS HOUSING.  THE BUILDING WILL ALSO HOUSE A [pause] GYMNASIUM AND DINING HALL.  THE INCREASE IN STUDENT SATISFACTION AND ENROLLMENT IS CALCULATED TO PRODUCE A [pause] 650,000 CREDIT INCREASE IN REVENUE OVER THIRTY YEARS.  COSTS OF CONSTRUCTING THE DORMITORIES HAS EXCEEDED PROJECTIONS BY 82% TO DATE."**

**On unexpected cost overruns: "THE LARGEST FACTOR IN DORMITORY CONSTRUCTION COST INCREASE IS CONTRACTOR AND SUBCONTRACTOR LABOR."**

**On Anttu: "PROVOST ANTTU HAS OBJECTED STRONGLY TO ALL PROPOSALS TO REDUCE SPENDING ON FACULTY OR RESEARCH, DESCRIBING IT AS QUOTE--" Maguaq's voice shifts suddenly, becoming more natural and sonorous "--'An utter desecration of the principles upon which this university, and indeed all universities, was built.' END QUOTE."**

**On Killa: "STUDENT REPRESENTATIVE KILLA HAS VISITED THIS OFFICE DURING WORKING HOURS ON 19 SEPARATE OCCASIONS, RESULTING IN A 4.1% DECREASE IN PRODUCTIVITY."  It may be a trick of the light, but you think you see the faintest, faintest trace of a smile on Maguaq's face.**

**About accounting irregularities: "NO IRREGULARITIES DETECTED."**

_I tried to provide some additional context for that last answer: "I'm not a forensic accountant, but I would say that Maguaq can tell that the inflows and outlays are consistent, that there's not money unaccounted for, but he may lack the cultural understanding to tell if something doesn't make sense.  For example, if he had a receipt showing that 8 million credits was spent on bubblegum, he'd be sure that the accounts reconciled, but he doesn't have the capacity to ask why so much was spent, or where it's being kept, or things like that.  At least, that's how I'm interpreting Maguaq and his answers, just so we're on the same page."_

_Panda: ask to review the books for your story_

**Maguaq pauses again before speaking.  "DEPARTMENT HEAD LEVEL OR HIGHER AUTHORIZATION REQUIRED TO DISCLOSE ACCOUNTING INFORMATION TO NON-UNIVERSITY STAFF."**

_Panda: can I ask Vinnie what he's thinking so far?_

**Vinnie says, "Didn't Teenu say that the Student Representative is on par with a department head for administrative purposes?  Killa could get him to give us the books, and then..." He waggles his eyebrows.**

**Killa's glad to help after you fill her in on what Maguaq's told you.  "Those numbers, like, don't sound right at all.  And if you find anything, put my name in your article's headline.  JK!"  You bring her to Maguaq's office, where she authorizes him to give you a copy of the books.**

**"Thanks Maguaq!" she squeals.  "You're so sweet."**

**Maguaq's face doesn't move.  "YOU ARE WELCOME, STUDENT REPRESENTATIVE KILLA.  IT IS MY [pause] PLEASURE TO HELP."  Vinnie waggles his eyebrows at you furiously.**

_Panda: Why don't you two catch up while we take a quick look? and then look at the books as best as we can_

**Looking over the books, there's clearly something weird in the accounting of the luxury dorm construction.  There are a lot of relatively small payments spread over a variety of companies with suspiciously generic names: 75,000 credits for ABC Plumbing, 90,000 credits for Very Good Insulation, 44,000 for North Zerv Painters LLC, 96,000 for PLR Insulation, and so forth.  "They're already hiring painters?" Vinnie asks.  "Didn't K'Sokher say they haven't laid the foundation yet?"  On a hunch, you start looking up the corporate registration of these contractors, which shows many of them list the same PO box as their headquarters.**

**You send a quick message to your shipping contacts in the region to ask if they know anything about these companies.**

_Bean asked how Maguaq calculated that the dorms would lead to a 650,000 credit increase in revenue.  My answer: "I don't feel like making up fake numbers that convincingly add up, but the basic idea behind the 650,000 amount is that A) there's increased tuition from the extra rooms, B) better living space leads to happier students, who eventually donate more, and C) nicer facilities on campus means you get a slightly better set of applicants, who are (marginally) more likely to be successful and thus more likely to donate in the future.  I assume it's the same reason real colleges do things like build super nice student unions and the like?  Maybe in real life they don't think they can quantify the benefit, though."_

**You look back at Killa and Maguaq.  The Bursar appears to be describing the use of check-sums to detect errors in double-entry bookkeeping, and Killa is hanging on his every word.  When you get a chance, you interrupt, "This is fascinating, Maguaq, but I wanted to ask you a question about your accident."**

**Maguaq's head jerks slightly a few times, then he says, "ERROR: RECORD NOT FOUND."**

**Killa scowls.  "He doesn't like to talk about it."  You take advantage of the pause to ask Killa if it'd be possible to talk to someone from the school paper, to get a broader sense of the student's-eye view of K'Sokher's chancellorship and maybe look at some of the contemporaneous reporting.  "Like, I thought that's why you were talking to me.  JK!  Let me give you Nelmari's number.  He's the current Editor-in-Chief and also a total gossip fiend.  He'd be, like, a great resource."**

**As you step out of Maguaq's office, you hear back from your friends in the regional shipping industry.  No one has any record of shipments being sent or received by any of the corporations you flagged.  "But I don't think plumbers need that many supplies," one writes drolly.  Another was curious enough that he tried to do some digging to track down the owners.  She found that these businesses were held by a smaller number of holding companies with even more generic names, mostly registered on Kanaloa.  ("They're pretty lax about business registration and tax enforcement," she notes.)  Those companies were held by other companies in a Byzantine web, and she has to concede that she was never able to find anything solid.  "At the top--at least, as far as I can tell it's the top--there's something called Hemasgeir LLC.  I can't tell you who owns it, but the address on file is a rented office about a mile from the university."**

_Panda: I say we go to the source and go check out that office_

**Given that Hemasgeir LLC seems to own dozens of smaller businesses that have collectively billed the university for millions of credits, you expected the office to be nicer.  At the very least, "not a shit heap" seemed like a reasonable standard.  But the office park where it's located appears abandoned, with graffiti sprawled across the walls and empty beer cans scattered through the parking lot.  "It should be #115," Vinnie says, but when you find it it's empty.  Only a small note requesting that any mail be forwarded to a PO box distinguishes this office from any other.**

_People ask if there's evidence that anyone's been by recently (there isn't) or if we can leave a bug/camera (we can, but there's no reason to think anyone's coming in the future).  Panda suggests checking the signature on the invoices that Maguaq showed us._

**The invoices were signed by a "Johari, Daughter of Johari"; per government records, she's a graduate of the North Zerv University School of Law and who passed the bar five years ago, but beyond that you can find very little about her.  Her registered office address is the same as Hemasgeir LLC's.**

_Go to Teenu, Vinnie's ex-wife_

**You head back to Teenu and go over your findings.  As you explain the cost overruns and suspicious billings for the luxury dormitory development, she buries her head in her hands.  "Of course it's those klyxe-fucked dorms.  K'Sokher can't go 10 minutes without bringing them up.  I always thought they were a fucking boondoggle, but this is even worse.  But then you just find out who's billing the university, right?"**

**"It's not that simple," you say, before telling her about Johari, Hemasgeir LLC, and the office park.**

**"I've never heard of Johari, but Hemasgier is interesting.  He was a historian, about...300 years ago, I want to say?  Wrote the definitive history of the Dog's War and the fall of the first United Zervian State.  Anttu's got a huge hard-ice for him--still insists that all history freshmen read his book, even though it's so long and dry."**

_Bean: Should we ask someone who's in charge of ordering stuff for the luxury dorms?_

**"I'm not sure who that would be," Teenu says.  "The dorms are K'Sokher's baby, so maybe try her?"**

_Someone new pops into the channel.  After I give him the run-down of the plot to date, they sarcastically suggest that the bulter did it._

**Teenu says, "The university laid off its butlers a few years ago.  It was one of K'Sokher's first acts as Chancellor.  Good riddance, too--it was such a weird elitist waste of money.  Anttu raised high dudgeon, of course.  'The butlers are absolutely essential to facilitate the atmosphere where professors are able to perform their vital research!'  What a blow-hard."**

**On Viilias: Teenu tells you that Viilias was the school's Chancellor for over 30 years.  She died shortly before K'Sokher was appointed, and naming the dormitory in her honor was a sign of respect.**

_Ask Killa and Maguaq if they've heard of Johari_

**"There was a Johari on my hall junior year," Killa tells you, "but I think she was, like, Daughter of Aluka.  Besides, this Johari graduated for law school 5 years ago?  The one I knew is, like, way too young."**

**Maguaq just says, "NO INDIVIDUAL MATCHING DESIGNATION JOHARI, DAUGHTER OF JOHARI FOUND."**

_Go to Nelmari, the school paper's Editor-in-Chief_

**The office of The Student Tribune is mostly empty at the moment, but it's not hard to imagine it when full, buzzing with activity.  The wall to your left has a large whiteboard with a list of reporters and topics they've been assigned, plus tentative plans for features to run over the coming week, while the wall to your right has a series of framed editions commemorating scoops going back decades--the resignation of Chancellor Viilias here, an exposé of the attempt the squash the dining staff's unionization efforts there.  The middle of the room is filled with long tables packed with computers, notepads, and other bric-a-brac.  You approach one of the only students in at the moment, a Ruamokan woman who looks to be working on the page layout.  You ask where to find Nelmari, and she just points to an office in the back.  The door is closed, with a hand-written "RECORDING" sign taped to it, and you can hear a muffled voice from inside, speaking very archly.  "Finally, which member of our championship golf-box team is under review for allegedly plagiarizing her thesis?  Let's just say that if I were her, I'd be "Shella" pissed!  This has been Nelmari, telling you who's who in the NZUniverse!"  Then a sigh, and more naturally, "OK, that's good."  Nelmari then opens the door to remove the sign and sees you standing there.**

**You tell him that...**  
[A] You're reporters writing a profile of Chancellor K'Sokher  
[B] You're reporters looking into possible embezzlement tied to the luxury dormitory cost overruns  
[C] You've been pretending to be reporters so you could investigate these embezzlement rumors, but it's exhausting keeping up the facade, please just don't tell anyone, all right?  
**...and he says, "And you thought little ol' moi would be able to give you the scoop on what's happening around here?  I'll dish, I'll dish, don't twist my arm!  What do you want to know about?"**  

_[C]_

**"From shoe leather to gumshoe?  I love it!  I won't blow up your spot, as long as we have a sclusy interview when you're done to spill the tea.  What do you want to know about?"**

**On luxury dorms: "Those are going to be swank, with a capital SW.  But no surprise someone's got their hand in the cookie jar.  They've been overbudget since day one.  K'Sokher's just gotta have her Xanadu.  Not to be confused with her Xanadude on the side, of course."**

**On Johari, Daughter of Johari: "Oh, I remember that basic bitch.  Real haughty, princess type, the type that just screams, 'Daddy issues!'  Probably why she fell for Anttu's whole distant, disapproving daddy vibe."**

_Panda: Nelmari, do you have any idea where Johari is these days?_

**"You're going to say this is an incredible coincidence, like a real narrative cheat, but actually, yeah, I do--she's in the apartment across the street from mine, I see her coming and going all the time.  Let me give you the address."**

**You and Vinnie exchange looks.  You're pretty confident that you understand what's happening now.  The next step should be to...**  
[A] Confront Anttu with what you know  
[B] Take your findings to Chancellor K'Sokher  
[C] Take your findings to the Interstellar Bureau of Investigations, financial crimes department  
[D] Lean on Johari to make the conclusion airtight  
[E] Investigate why Maguaq didn't remember Johari  
[F] Something else  

_[D]_

**Before you go to question Johari, you say to Vinnie, "Should we be wearing suits?  Like, to imply that we're IBI agents?"  He groans; you're always trying to find an excuse to wear nice clothes, and he isn't having it.**

**Johari's apartment building's a little rundown--there's a thin layer of built-up grime everywhere, the walls need to be repainted, and Vinnie notes that the elevator's safety inspection certificate expired two years ago.  It's nicer than some of the places you lived in your 20s, but not by much.  You knock on Johari's door and announce yourselves, and she lets you in.**

**It turns out to be a studio apartment, with the same assemble-it-yourself desk, table, and bookshelf every young person gets.  Johari doesn't appear to entertain often; she and Vinnie sit in the only two chairs, leaving you standing awkwardly.  You lay out what you know--Anttu, her one-time lover, has been leeching millions of credits from the university through the new luxury dormitories, and she's helped by setting up the layers of shell companies to hide his involvement.  She, naturally, denies everything: "Yes, I knew Anttu at school, and yes, we had an affair, but we were both adults.  But Hemasgeir LLC and this contractor fraud?  I have no idea what you're talking about."**

**Do you:**  
[A] Play good cop--"We know Anttu tricked you into helping, but you don't need to have your life ruined by this.  Anttu's the one we're after.  Let your conscience be clear."  
[B] Play bad cop--"Don't give us that bullshit.  Your name's on all the paperwork.  Start talking or we go straight to the IBI."  
[C] Ask her about another topic  
[D] Something else  

_Panda asks about the evidence we have.  I explain, "You have documents showing Johari's fingerprints all over the various layers of shell corporations, but that's not proof in itself of wrongdoing--it would be possible for legitimate businesses to be structured like this, including using the same lawyers.  At this point, Johari could claim that she isn't aware of any embezzlement, that she as far as she knew ABC Plumbing really was doing the construction work, and you wouldn't be able to disprove it.  (It presumably wouldn't hold up in the long-term, after more research and careful bookkeeping, but at the moment there's not a smoking gun.)"  People decide to show this evidence to Johari with a soft touch._

**You lay out the documentation you have.  "Johari, your name's on all of these.  If you truly haven't seen these before, then someone--probably Anttu--is setting you up, and it's even more important that you cooperate with us.  And even if you were part of this, he's made himself a millionaire, and you're well..." You glance around the apartment.  "You're living here."**

**Johari takes in the evidence.  "No, no," she says finally.  "This can't be.  Anttu wouldn't-- I mean, I know he-- But he wouldn't..." and she bursts into tears.**

**Do you:**  
[A] (soft) Comfort her  
[B] (hard) Tell her, "Can the crocodile tears, sweetheart.  Just give us the dirt on Anttu and we'll be on our way."  
[C] Something else  

_[A]_

**You walk to her to put your hand on her shoulder, but she stands as well and pulls you into a hug, burying her face on your shoulder.  You feel her rhythmic sobbing, but then her weight starts to shift oddly, and you hear Vinnie start to cry out as you feel a sharp pain in your side.**

**You try to stagger back, but now Johari won't let go.  She spins you around so that she's holding you from behind, and moves the knife up to your neck.  Vinnie freezes.  "Don't move!" she hisses.  "You take one step and the knife's in his fucking neck, you got it?"**

**You're having trouble focusing, and you're not sure why your shirt's so wet near your abdomen.  What do you do?**  
[A] (soft) You say (well, whisper, really), "Y-You don't have to do this, Johari."  
[B] (hard) Using those martial arts moves you learned at Big Susan's compound, you disarm her.  
[C] You're just going to close your eyes for a minute, you're really tired for some reason  
[D] Something else  

_[B], and also a "semi-serious" suggestion that Ethanicus dies and we take over Vinnie_

**Unfortunately, your time with Big Susan was spent letting her men practice attacking you, so you're more more used to being the one with the knife who's being dropped.  You're pretty sure you know how it works, though--but that might be the blood loss talking.  You grab her hand that's holding the knife to stabilize it and then quickly swing your head back, hitting her in the face and allowing you to step out from her grasp.**

**Or, that's the theory, at least.  Why are you moving so sluggishly?  And shouldn't she be reacting to the pain?  Why does Vinnie look so scared, since you've definitely...got this...under...control...**

**You regain consciousness to the sound of beeping.  "Hey, you're awake, buddy," Vinnie says.  "Don't try to move."  Based on the drop ceiling, the uncomfortable bed you're on, and the ambient noise, you conclude you're in a hospital.**

**"Johari?" you whisper.**

**"Oh, I took her out as soon as you were down," Vinnie says.  "That knife wasn't getting through this," and he taps his rock body.  "She's in jail.  Anttu too."  He smiles.  "Heh, 'tutu'."**

**"But, uh, there's someone else here to see you," Vinnie says.**

**You try to ask who, but just then the door opens, revealing...**  
[A] Your (step?) father  
[B] Your (step?) mother  
[C] Your (step?) brother  
[D] Your (step?) sister  
**...who you haven't seen in over a decade, since...**  
[A] You turned your back on the family business, making and selling shoes  
[B] You turned your back on the family business, making and selling weapons  
[C] You turned your back on the family business, running short cons on rubes  
[D] You washed out of the Federated Space Patrol  
[E] They joined the True Devotees of the Laughing God (the much less popular, much more cult-like Crin'tiki church)  
[F] You went into business with a Ruamokan (or, as they call them, "a rockfucker")  
[G] Something else  

_[A] [B], and name the character "Jimbo"_

**"Ethanicus, you're awake!" Jimbo cries out.**

**You look at Vinnie.  "You were in a bad spot there for a few days," he explains.  "The hospital reached out to him."**

**"Of course they did," Jimbo snaps.  "I know we've had our differences, but do you really think I wouldn't want to know about this?  I rushed across the sector to be by your side."**

**"That's true," Vinnie says.  "He hasn't left the hospital in over four days."**

**At this point a nurse enters and, seeing you're awake, shoos Vinnie and Jimbo out of the room so he can tend to you.**

**About an hour later, the nurse is done with his work, and you're feeling good enough to speak again.  Vinnie and Jimbo come back into the room.**

**"Ethanicus," Jimbo starts.  "I'm-- I'm sorry that the business came between us.  I'm your father and I've missed you.  I want to be part of your life."**

**You say...**  
[A] "I missed you too, Dad."  
[B] "Are you still a war profiteer?  If so, we have nothing to talk about."  
[C] Nothing  
[D] Something else  

_Panda: I would see what some others want to do but I would say let's be cold and accept him back at some level but imply that it's conditional on how much he's still involved in the arms business, or if he is willing to change things for the better, etc_

**"It ain't like that, son.  We help oppressed people liberate themselves.  And if we didn't sell the weapons, someone else would."**

**"Sure sounds like war profiteering to me," you reply.**

**"Listen--No.  I'm not doing this again.  You've said your piece, and I've said mine.  I thought we could be adults, but I know where you got your bullheadedness, and I won't fault you for it.  But before I say goodbye for another decade, I wanted to hire you and Vinnie."**

**Vinnie's as surprised as you are.  "We're not in the arms business," he says.**

**"I know, I know," Jimbo says, "and I'm not asking you to be.  But there's a conference in the Orion system I want to attend."**

**"A conference," you repeat, measuredly.**

**"It's more of a trade show.  Talk to other people in...my line of work, do some networking, things like that.  The company ship's tied up in deliveries, and I thought, as long as I was buying transport..."**

**You glance over at Vinnie, then say...**  
[A] "Fine.  But money up front, and we're charging an extra 25%."  
[B] "There's not a chance, Dad."  
[C] Something else  

_Panda: I'm inclined to go with C and just give him the ride per normal. I don't see any reason to gouge him if it's a simple passenger deal. But I want to cut it with a remark about how we know that even if we didn't give him the ride, "someone else would".  Also, people want to tie up the loose ends in the story before we move on._

**"What about Nelmari's story?" you ask Vinnie.**

**"He only interviewed me for it.  He couldn't just wait around for you to wake up.  News never sleeps, as they say."  He holds up a copy of The Student Tribune with headline PROVOST ARRESTED IN EMBEZZLEMENT SCANDAL.  "There's even a big feature on us."  Vinnie opens the newspaper up to a page with the headline CORRUPTION UNCOVERED BY INVESTIGATIVE COURIERS, illustrated with an old publicity picture of you and Vinnie standing back-to-back with your armed crossed.  "There's some really kind stuff in here about you," he says.  "Like how you're too good for this world.  I told Nelmari that you weren't going to die, but he insisted it made a better story."**

**The next day, the doctors decide you're well enough to discharge you.  You, Vinnie, and Jimbo then spend that afternoon and evening preparing a romantic meal for Killa and Maguaq, with many zany complications.  But after Vinnie's hat catches on fire, you disguise the fast-food tacos as haut cuisine, and Maguaq stands up to Killa's obnoxious ex, the two finally kiss.  It's sweet, even though you, Vinnie, and Jimbo are all high-fiving as it happens.**

### Chapter 4: The Cat's In The Cradle

**The day after that, you, Vinnie, and Jimbo set off for the Orion system.  With your upgraded engines, the trip should take a little over two days, leaving plenty of time for your and your father to talk, or to sit in awkward silence, whichever.  In bits and pieces, you get him to tell you what he's most interested in at this conference:**  
[A] New advancements in personal shield technology, which he's hoping to license  
[B] A rival trader, Zhang McMullen, is down on his luck, and Jimbo's wants to buy him out  
[C] Scuttlebutt is that representatives from the Walanese emperor-in-exile will be there, which would be a huge contract  
[D] There's another arms merchant, Sheila Sharma, who Jimbo hooks up with at every conference ("Your mother's long gone, Ethanicus, and I'm still human.")  
[E] Something else  

_[A] / [C]_

**The personal shield technology sounds interesting, and could potentially save lives, for a change.  On the other hand, you hate to admit it, but you're never able to keep the current political situation in the Wala system straight--between the Walanese government, the Walanese emperor-in-exile, the Walanese Liberation Army, and The People's Republic of Wala, you're pretty sure one is a reasonable group of activists fighting off encroaching authoritarianism (but occasionally too violently), two are jack-booted thugs (which still raise legitimate issues about the ideology of their opposition), and the last is either a theocratic death cult or burn-it-all-down radical anarchists, but you can never remember which group is which.  You're not going to acknowledge that to your father, though, so you limit yourself to a non-committal "Uh huh."**

**You spend most of the time...**  
[A] Arguing about sports  
[B] Arguing about movies  
[C] Singing along to the radio (with occasional arguments about music)  
[D] Playing Altair rummy  
[E] Something else  

_[C] / [D]_

**The hours pass with a mix of singalongs and card games, and as you fall asleep the first night, you have to grudgingly admit that you don't hate this.**

**You're awakened around 2 AM by a blaring alarm.  You leap into the pilot's chair and check the status.  "Pirates!" you shout.  "It looks like three of them on our tail.  Hold on!"  You veer hard to starboard to try to shake them loose.**

**"Just blast 'em!" Jimbo shouts.  You ignore him and execute a quick loop to get behind the pirates, using the moment of confusion to look for a place to hide.  It looks like there's a binary star in a nebula not far from here where you might be able to evade their sensors.**

**"No, really, just shoot 'em!" you father repeats.  "Pirates are scavengers, they'll leave you alone if show 'em your teeth.  Make 'em realize you're not worth the trouble."**

**You're too focused on the evasive maneuvers to answer, but Vinnie helps out.  "Jimbo...we don't have any blasters.  Those are just decoys out there, meant to stop attacks.  They won't be much help now."**

**You're getting close to the nebula, but the pirates have realized your plan.  Two are in pursuit, but you lose sight of the third, until it drops in immediately in front of your, guns screaming.  You and Vinnie hold tight while you push your ship down and hard to port, but Jimbo's still dumb-founded, muttering, "No blasters?!" and doesn't realize what's happening until it's too late.  He's thrown across, and there's an awkward crunch followed by a howl of pain.**

**There are bigger problems, though.  One of the pirates has managed to clip your navigational thrusters, and your controls are much more sluggish, which in turn just makes it easier for the pirates to keep dinging you.  Rather than let than capture you push all your remaining fuel into a quick burst away from the battle, which leaves the pirates far behind but also puts you uncomfortably close to the smaller half of that binary star.  You manage to avoid being sucked instead, instead slingshotting around at breakneck speed until you're on collision course with a planet orbiting the stars.  Your luck runs out, and you're not able to dodge it this time; you barely have time to shout the customary "Brace for impact!" before your ship hits the planet's surface.**

**You come to sore all over, with Vinnie rubbing smelling salts under your nose.  His Ruamokan hide was study enough to survive the crash no worse for wear, as you're sure he's going to remind you, for months.  He gives a rundown of the situation.**

**"The ship's banged-up, but it'll survive.  There are some ruptured fuel lines and fried circuitry, but nothing we couldn't fix, if we had the parts.  Unfortunately, I checked, and there's no autoshop on this uninhabited planet.  The communications array took a big hit, so we're going to need to use the emergency beacon, but between the nebula, the two suns, and the crash site, it's not going to work here."**

**"Wait," you ask.  "What about the crash site?"**

**Vinnie explains...**  
[A] "There's a permanent thunder storm out there, kicking up ionic interference."  
[B] "We're surrounded by giant trees, several yards thick and looks to be a few miles high."  
[C] "You managed to crash us into a cave system, and all the iron and magnesium's screwing with the signal."  
[D] Something else  

**"Great," you say.  "And my father?"**

**"He's still out, and his leg's broken," Vinnie says.  "It wouldn't be hard for a doctor to repair, but..." he gestures around.  "I put him in a splint from our first-aid kit.  He'll be able to move, but it'll be slow-going."**

**"So, we just have to take the emergency beacon and my injured father and, what, hike up a mountain until we can transmit the distress signal?" you ask.  "Doesn't sound like a great time, but doable."**

**Vinnie hesitates.  "Well, there's one other thing, E.  I peeked outside, and I think I saw--well, I don't want to say 'monsters', but..."**

**What type of monsters are on this planet?**  
[A] Cats that glow in the dark  
[B] Giant insects and spiders  
[C] Dragons?  Maybe not dragons, but giant lizards that can fly and spit fire, so... Yeah, we'll call them dragons.  
[D] All you know is that they're invisible and huge  
[E] It's like an ooze that slowly takes over all other lifeforms, transforming them into zombies that want only to spread the ooze  
[F] Something else  

_[B] [A]_

**The course forward is clear.  The good news is that you won't need to climb to the top of a mountain to get a signal, just above the tree line.  The bad news is that, based on scans of the area, it looks to be quite a long hike.  You and Vinnie spend the time before sun-up preparing--packing bags with rations, preparing a simple travois to haul the distress beacon, and so forth.  Just before daybreak, Jimbo awakens, and you fill him in.**

**He mulls over the situation.  "I'm not happy about it, but I think you know what you need to do.  Just leave me in the shuttle while you and Vinnie go on the hike."**

**"But, Dad," you say, "I can't just leave you behind.  What about those cat monsters?"**

**"Leave me a blaster and I'll scare 'em off if they come too close.  It's not like it'd be any easier for you to keep me safe on the climb.  'Sides which, I'll just slow you down with my leg how it is."**

**Vinnie glances at you.  "He has a point, E--it'll take us at least five days to make it up with him.  We could do it on our own in two."**

**You look down at the ground for a while before you respond...**  
[A] "I'm not going to abandon you, Dad.  Any place we go on this planet, we go together."  
[B] "You're right--it's not worth the risk of staying on this planet any longer than we need to.  We'll leave you a communicator so that we can stay in touch and mark our progress."  
[C] Something else  

_[B]_

**You can't argue with the logic, so you agree to leave Jimbo behind, along with a few days worth of rations, painkillers, a communicator, and a blaster.  When he realizes that you only had two in total (because it's not like you or Vinnie thought you'd need more than one), he tries to object, telling you to keep it, but you insist.  Things may be rough between you, but you're not going to leave your father defenseless against incadescent cats.**

**With that, you and Vinnie set off.  Even with both suns up, the canopy is so dense that not much light gets through, making it seem like permanent twilight.  "The trees are giants," Vinnie says, which is basic enough that you don't respond.  "And those glow-in-the-dark cats were also giant."**

**"...And?" you ask.**

**"Well, what if, and hear me out, this is one of those giant planets, like from the movies.  And next thing you know, we're going to find a coin that's like, 20 feet across."**

**"What?"**

**"You know, a giant coin.  Giant trees, giant cat, giant coin."**

**"Hold on," you say.  "If there were giant people, wouldn't we have noticed?"**

**"Maybe they're hiding."**

**"And I don't even think that's the right scale.  Like, the cats are maybe five times larger than normal.  The trees are about 100 times larger.  But this coin is, what, 250 times larger?"**

**"Maybe the giants like big coins."  This argument eats up several hours of the hike.**

**You and Vinnie make good time heading up the mountain.  You don't see any monsters yourselves, but there are worrisome signs.  Trees with giant slash marks, animal corpses not completely devoured.  As night falls, you think you begin to hear movement coming from the forest around you, first distant, but getting closer, mixed with muffled mewing.  As you and Vinnie make camp for the first night, it's clear what you have to do...**  
[A] Sleep in shifts, so that one person's always on guard  
[B] Climb one of the trees and sleep on its branches  
[C] Rig up some blasters to shoot anything that moves within five feet of the tent  
[D] Something else  

_[A] / [B]_

**You're always amazed by how good Vinnie is at climbing things, given his rather squat and dense body, but he scrambles up the side of the tree in no time, lowering a rope to help your ascent.  Once you're settled, you radio back to Jimbo for a status update.**

**"I'm just dandy," he says.  "I haven't seen or heard anything.  Got a lot of reading done."**

**You drew short straw, so you're first shift while Vinnie sleeps.  Concerned light would attract predators, all you can do is squint into the darkness with a hand clutched on the blaster and listen to music softly on your headphones.  Things are peaceful at first, and over time your eyes acclimate to the dark, but a few hours in you realize your eyesight shouldn't be getting this much better after so long in the dark.  You shut your music off and peak over the edge of a branch.  You can see luminescent flashes pacing between the trees, and they seem to be getting closer.  You can do nothing but watch.  The lights stand still for a few seconds, and then suddenly there's there's the noise of a scramble, a stampede, as three of the monsters drive what looks like a deer with six legs into the space just below the branch.  One of the beasts has managed to flank the deer(oid), and now they have it pinned against the three.  It makes one final leap toward freedom, but you know how it will end; you look away and can only listen to the noises of flesh being torn and consumed.**

**You're worried that the monsters might have heard or smelled you, but they show no sign of it.  After their meal is done, they langorously stretch out and begin to snooze.**

**Do you...**  
[A] Start blasting now that they're asleep  
[B] Throw some gear into the distance to try to rouse and divert them  
[C] Radio Jimbo again to make sure he's still all right, now that you know the monsters are real  
[D] Assume they'll wake and leave before morning, so no reason to do anything now  

_[C]_

**Slowly, still fearful that noise might attract the beasts' attention, you bring out your communicator and contact Jimbo.  Maybe he's blissfully asleep, you tell yourself, but no, he answers immediately.  You tell him what you've seen.**

**He also speaks softly.  "Yeah, sounds right.  Nothing's looked inside the ship yet, but from the sound of it, some of these cat-monsters were hunting and feeding right outside.  I'm safe, but my blaster's in my hand and I don't think I'll be sleeping tonight."**

_I think I lost an update here?  There should be something about you staying awake and quiet until the shift change, after which you get a few hours of not-very-restful sleep.  When you wake, Vinnie tells you that the cat-monsters woke and left just before dawn, then you continue your trek._

**Judging from your map, you're right on pace, and you expect to reach a high enough altitude to activate the beacon just around nightfall.  The first few hours pass mostly in silence; neither you nor Vinnie (nor Jimbo, when you contact him) have much to say at this point.**

**Around 11 AM, just as you're starting to think about breaking for lunch, Vinnie stops suddenly, and motions you to do the same.  You try to ask what's happening, but he quickly shushes you, then starts to slowly turn his head.  Eventually, he points off in that distance, and whispers, "Pass me the binoculars."  You do so, and he peers through them, adjusting the zoom until he finds what he's looking for.  Wordlessly, he hands them off to you so you can take a look.**

**About a mile off there are four people, wearing armor (including helmets) and carrying blasters.  You don't recognize the armor and can't make out the species from here--wrong proportions for Ruamokans, and the helmet wouldn't fit Crin'tiki, but they could be human, Zervian, Kanaloan, or a dozen other options.  They look well-trained and appear to be sweeping the forest; three are constantly looking around the landscape, and the fourth, you guess a squad leader, will periodically stop and check a tablet and have them slightly adjust their heading.  From the look of it, they're not on path to meet you, but they do seem to be heading for your ship's crash site.**

**Do you...**  
[A] Start heading toward them to ask for help  
[B] Start heading back to set up an ambush  
[C] Contact Jimbo to keep him informed  
[D] Something else  

_[C]_

**You relay what you've seen to Jimbo.  There's a period of silence, and you think the communicator might have futzed out, but then Jimbo asks, quietly, "Is their armor red, with darker red patches?"**

**"Yes," you reply, suspicious.  "How did you know that?"**

**He ignores you, and mutters, more to himself, "Four of them, moving carefully, so call it a day and a half to get here.  You and Vinnie are, what, four hours out from deploying the beacon, if you hustle?  But then Zhang would know exactly where we are, and he'd have a head start on any rescue..."**

**"What's this about, Dad?" you ask, forcefully.**

**"Those men?  They're Zhang McMullen and some of his mercs.  We were in talks for a merger and it fell through, but he...thinks I stole his customer list and the schematics and prototype for a new blaster."**

**You start to connect the dots.  "So the pirates..."**

**"Yeah, probably hired by Zhang.  Now he's looking for the crash site to see try to find his stuff."**

**"Which you don't have, right, Dad?" you say sharply.**

**Jimbo just lets out an extended, "Wellllll..."  You sigh.  "Let's see," he says.  "It'll be four-on-one, they're in armor, and I'm not exactly mobile, but the ship's door is a choke point and this new blaster model, hoo boy.  So I think I can hold them off for a time, at least."**

**Do you...**  
[A] Stick to the plan--head above the tree line, activate the beacon, hope a friendly ship finds you before Zhang kills your father  
[B] Book it back to the ship to defend Jimbo  
[C] Split up--have Vinnie take the beacon up the mountain, while you head back to the ship (If you choose this, who takes your one blaster?)  
[D] Try to parley with Zhang McMullen (If you choose this, also say what you're going to offer and what you hope they'll give in exchange)  
[E] Something else  

_Panda: "(Okay, throwing this out there, but do we know if Zhang has a crush on anyone such that we could fix him up on a romantic dinner?)"_

**"Zhang's happily married," Jimbo says.  "His husband is named Rick.  Really great guy.  I don't think the romantic dinner plan will work."**

_[D], plus offer to return all stolen material and renegotate the merger_

**You and Vinnie head toward Zhang and his men, being sure to loudly announce your presence and hold your arms above your head when you get close.  Zhang watches you skeptically as you plead your case.**

**"It's great that Jimbo will hand over the blaster and my customer list," he says, "but seems to me that's just giving me what's mine.  I need more than restitution.  I want to make sure he thinks twice before pulling this shit again.  My plan had been to shoot him in the back of the head and then dissolve his body in acid, but y'know, I'm open to other ideas."**

**You think quickly, and realize you can sweeten the deal by offering...**  
[A] For Jimbo to do everything in his power to help Zhang begin supplying the Walanese emperor-in-exile  
[B] To serve as Zhang's personal courier, no questions asked, for the next year  
[C] To tell him everything you know about Big Susan's compound and her upcoming deals and scores (as you learned about while serving as training dummies for her guards)  
[D] To let him take on Jimbo's fingers as a permanent reminder  
[E] Something else  

_[A], but also say that we discussed this with him before approaching Zhang_

**Jimbo wasn't receptive when you first suggested this, but you made your case.  "Zhang has all the leverage now.  Best case is, what, you take out two of his men, then he comes back with reinforcements?  We make it off the planet and he just hits you again, harder?"  Your father has to reluctantly concede the point.**

**Zhang agrees on what condition--it's an acquisition, not a merger, and Jimbo doesn't have a place in the organization afterwards.  "After what he pulled, I couldn't trust him."  And so you, Zhang, and Jimbo are eventually able to negotiate a deal: Jimbo gives back what he stole, his current holdings, and his employees.  Jimbo will keep his company ship and try to rebuild his business, provided he doesn't sell in this or any neighboring sector for five years.  "As far as I'm concerned, you're klyxe shit," Zhang says, "and I'll tell anyone who'll listen.  But if you can build yourself back up after this, more power to you."  He also agrees to contact your insurance company and have them send a repair ship, which arrives a day after Zhang leaves.**

_Panda asks about our relationship with Jimbo going forward.  I say: "Jimbo doesn't hate you--he acknowledges that Zhang really had him over a barrel, and seems genuinely remorseful that you got pulled into this.  He offered to pay for the ship repairs, but you know that after trading away his entire business (and with you being relatively flush), he needs the money more than you do.  As for future plans, arms dealing is the only life he knows, and even after giving up his company he still has valuable contacts (suppliers that trust him and the like), so he's going to try to rebuild.  It'll be slow going, but he built his business up from nothing once before.  He's still interested in being your father if you'll let him into your life, but because he agreed not to do business in Zhang's territory he probably won't be in your neck of the woods very often (but the geography's pretty fuzzy and we can fudge that if need to)."_

#### Chapter 5: Bad Times at Ramanujan Station

**Fixing up your ship is more expensive than you expected; thanks to the windfall from the Pre-Zervian find, you're not wiped out completely, but it's close.  There's not much for you to do besides book another job.  The best option looks to be going to a frontier outpost station to deliver:**  
[A] An up-and-coming band with a gig in the station's commissary  
[B] Divorce papers to a rich but uncooperative Federated Space functionary  
[C] A pair of newlyweds, en route to a safari honeymoon  
[D] An off-the-books shipment of high-quality liquor  
[E] Something else  

_[A]  The band is made of Ruamokans and named "The Rolling Stones", which they don't realize is_ also _an ancient Earth reference.  The lead singer is named "Mick Jagged"._

**The Rolling Stones are a protowave band started by three Ruamokans who met as students at North Zerv University.  After some cajoling, they let you play their demo on the ship's speakers.  They kind of sound like the Goose Juice Three, with more of a slowcore vibe, you tell them.  Nicky, the bassist, is enthusiastic.  "I love the Goose Juice Three!" he says.  "I had 'Gravedigger's Blues' on repeat all freshman year, mate."  There's a dismissive pshaw from behind your pilot's chair.  "Oi, just ignore Chrissy," Nicky says.  "If it were her choice, no one'd ever make music that people like."  You glance back at the drummer; she seems sullen, with some dark body-paint giving her zebra stripes, and she's typing furiously on her tablet.**

**Mick Jagged, the lead singer, rouses himself from a nap, and it takes him a second to process where he is and what he's hearing.  "Can you turn that tape off?" he asks.  "I hate listening to my own stuff."**

**Ramanujan Station, your destination, is a little frontier outpost at the edge of settled space.  It's far enough out, in fact, that one of the main jobs of the crew is setting up the local subwave beacons; for now, at least, the only way to communicate is to have someone fly about three hours toward civilization and transmit from there.  "When we were booking this gig, and didn't hear back, we didn't know if things fell through or if they just couldn't be bothered to send a courier that day," Nicky says.**

**Ramanujan Station will eventually hold a population of over three thousand, but for now there's basically a skeleton crew as it gets up and running, a few dozen total.  "Is it really worth bringing in a band for so few people?" Vinnie asks.**

**"People on these isolated stations go a little stir-crazy," Mick says, "so the commander likes to bring in some entertainment for a week every few months just to break up the monotony.  Least, that's what Commander Lopez says."**

**"But no one else wants to go to Bumfuck Station, so they're stuck with us," Chrissy adds.**

**You're still several hours out from the station.  Is there anything else you want to ask the band about?**  
[A] Commander Lopez  
[B] Other station crew  
[C] Musical influences  
[D] North Zerv University  
[E] Something else  

_[C]_

**"Too many to name, mate," Nicky says.  "Obviously the Bauxite Boys and Home Beyond The Stars.  Lately I've been getting into beta-baroque acts like Directive Sourdough and Jokur, Son of Jona.  You know, 'Looking ahead, standing tall...'" he starts to sing.**

**Mick quickly joins in.  "'Don't need to keep my back against the wall!'  I love that song.  Jokur was the first concert I ever went to.  That would have been the Eternal Winter tour.  Blew me away."**

**You turn to the drummer.  "What about you, Chrissy?"**

**She answers, "You know the sound of an avalanche crushing cattle?  That's what I like."**

**"Oi, come on, don't be like that," Nicky cajoles.  "I know you're into Wyld Pythons."**

**She glowers.  "Fine, yes, I like Wyld Pythons.  The early stuff, though.  Not 'Fear of a Rock Planet'."**

**Most of the journey is uneventful.  As expected, your subwave coverage gets spottier as you approach the station, and it goes out entirely when you're three hours out.  "Say goodbye to the rest of the universe," Chrissy says.**

**When you're 20 minutes away you enter radio range of the station.  Vinnie signals your approach:  "Breaker, this is Vinnie and Ethanicus, Federated Space registration number 6-4-8-3-5-5, here to drop off your musical guests, do you copy?"  There's no answer.**

**"Old thing's probably on the fritz," you say, but wouldn't the mechanics have fixed that when doing the repairs after the crash?**

**You never get a response, but when you're close enough the automated docking system kicks in, gently gliding your ship into the bay.  Inside the station, the lights are dim and the air chilly; you wish you'd brought a coat, but the Ruamokans are fine.  "Commander Lopez warned us about that," Mick says,  "While they're still setting the station up, they run everything in low-power mode to save energy."**

**Speaking of Commander Lopez, someone needs to sign off on your invoice.  Normally there'd be someone on-hand to greet the incoming ship and make sure the paperwork's in order, but no one else is here.  Maybe they just couldn't spare the manpower?  The best thing to do would probably be...**  
[A] To go to the station's command center and find someone who can authorize your payment  
[B] Head to the commissary to see where the Rolling Stones will be performing over the next week  
[C] Something else  

_[C] Wait for someone to show up_

**You stand around the docking bay, twiddling your thumbs, for twenty minutes.  There's no sign of life.  Eventually, Chrissy gets tired of waiting.  "Screw this," she says, "I'm going to the commissary.  I could use some grub."  The other Rolling Stones follow her out the door.**

**Do you...**  
[A] Follow them to the commissary  
[B] Head to Command  
[C] Leave the station, abandoning your paycheck (and also your new friends)  
[D] Something else  

_[A] (bringing along blasters)_

**You follow the band out into the corridor, and follow signs for the commissary.  There's no one in the halls, but you do start to see signs of life, little scuff marks and such that make it clear other people have been here.  As you move toward the fore and climb to the upper deck, there's more of this, and some more overt signs of distress--a hole punched in a wall, automatic doors propped open, the word "Why?" graffitied across a wall in big block letters.  When you enter the commissary from the aft you see a group of six disheveled people wearing blindfolds and eating silently.  It looks like they haven't changed clothes in days.  After a second of watching them, Mick clears his throat.**

**Everyone whips off their blindfolds and spins around to face you.  Five of the six instinctually grab hold of what look to be improvised weapons--a broken mop handle for one, a serving knife for another.  "Who the hell are you?" a red-haired woman shouts.**

**"The, uh, The Rolling Stones, ma'am," Mick answers.  The woman narrows her eyes.  "The band?  We have a deal to perform here for the next week."**

**Recognition passes over the face of the one man who's unarmed.  "Was that today?  I mean, oh..."  He stands up straighter, quickly adjusts his hair and uniform, then says much more resolutely, "Of course, of course, the entertainment.  Well, I'm Commander Lopez, and, on behalf of the entire crew, let me the first to welcome you to Ramanujan Station."  He steps toward Mick with an outstretched hand.**

**"Oh, cram it," the woman says.  "You've got a ship, right?  We need to get the hell out of here."**

**"You know we can't," Lopez says.  He looks for support from the other crew members, but they deflect their eyes.  He looks back to Mick.  "We've had a bit of...unpleasantness...but you might be able to help us."  Lopez looks over the band and seems to realize you (Ethanicus) are present for the first time and tenses up.  He looks back at Mick, and kind of does a stage whisper out the side of his mouth, "Were there always five people in your band?  And one of them human?"**

**You say, "Uh, no, I'm the pilot who brought them out here."  Lopez shoots a quick look to Mick, who gives a little confirmatory shrug, and Lopez relaxes again.**

**Do you...**  
[A] Offer to help the station crew in whatever way you can  
[B] Press Lopez (or the woman) for more information about this "unpleasantness"  
[C] Suggest a rousing Rolling Stones concert would be the perfect thing to lift everyone's spirit  
[D] Tell people there's space on your ship for all of them and invite them to leave the station with you  
[E] Run back to your ship, abandoning everyone here to their fate  
[F] Fire a blaster into the air to get everyone's attention, then do one of the other choices  
[G] Something else  

_[G] Stay silent, let the band take the lead / [B]_

**Before you say anything, Nicky speaks up.  "Ooh, that food looks great.  Can I have some?  We haven't had lunch yet."**

**Lopez is caught off-guard.  "Sure, I guess," he says, before remembering his position.  "I mean, you are of course welcome to share in some of our delicious Ramanujan Station cuisine."**

**The other crew members look apprehensive, but the red-headed woman agrees.  "We've got more than we need," she says.  "Take what you want."**

**So you sit with the station crew and have an awkward meal.  You learn a little about them:  The red-headed woman is Alexandra Sandiego, the station's chief engineer and third-in-command ("Well, second, now," she says, followed by an awkward silence).**

**There's also:**  
* **Beth "Rocksteady" Park, a female human engineer**  
* **Xyxkyd, a female Crin'tiki engineer**  
* **Richard von Fischtz, a male human scientist**  
* **Klob-Galob, a genderless Walanese medic**  

**The crew is not very forthcoming about the details of the situation.  When you ask why they were all blindfolded, there's a silence until Xyxkyd says softly, "It helps if you can't see them," and no one makes eye contact.**

**You press the topic despite everyone's clear discomfort.  Lopez again tries to play the ambassador.  "As you might know, part of the reason the station is located here is so that we could study the micropulsar."  He gestures up through the window at a swirling mass of blue and green.  "Well, there was...an accident.  But with the help of your ship," he looks at you and Vinnie, "we can make things right."**

**"No," Sandiego says sharply.  "With your ship we can get away before it's too late."**

**Lopez rubs his face.  "Please, Alex," he says with a mix of exasperation and empathy.  "We have an obligation--"**

**Klob-Galob cuts him off.  "We have an obligation to save ourselves."**

**Before things get more raucous, do you...**  
[A] Side with the Commander.  "We'll do whatever you think we need to to fix this."  
[B] Side with Sandiego.  "We can be off the station in 10 minutes."  
[C] Demand more information about the accident/situation on the station  
[D] Say nothing, just watch where this goes.  
[E] Something else
